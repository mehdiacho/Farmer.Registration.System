Project Title: Farmer Registration System

Project Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to build a Java GUI desktop application to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in registering farmers across the country. The system will capture important information about farmers such as their ID number, full names, postal address, gender, contact number, email address, district, sub district, size of farm in hectares, and area available for farming in hectares.

Users:
There are two types of users for the system, the farmer and the administrator. The farmer will be able to sign up, sign in, update their profile, and update their details. The administrator will have the ability to approve or decline any registration request, view all registered farmers, edit or delete farmers, and generate reports.

Reports:
The application will allow the administrator to print a list of all registered farmers to a text file, apply a filter to only show farmers belonging to a certain district or sub district, and provide a filter to only show farmers of a certain gender.

Technology Used:
This project was built using Java, and a Java GUI was used to develop the application's user interface. The system was designed to be user-friendly, and all the required information is captured through a registration form. The data will be stored in a database, and the application will provide the necessary functionality to manage the data.

Conclusion:
The Farmer Registration System is a comprehensive tool that will help the Ministry of Agriculture manage the information of farmers across the country. The system provides an easy and efficient way to capture, store, and manage farmer information. It is user-friendly, secure, and offers a range of features to meet the needs of both farmers and administrators.
